# Practical OPNsense

Simple packet filters are becoming a thing of the past. Even the open-source domain is moving towards Next-Generation Firewalls. And [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) is a top player when it comes to intrusion detection, application control, web filtering, and anti-virus.

__The third edition of this book is available since May 2021 as printed book.__

## Building Enterprise Firewalls with Open Source

![Cover image](images/brickwall_256px.png)

No network is too insignificant to be spared by an attacker. Even home networks, washing machines, and smartwatches are threatened and require a secure environment.

Firewalls are a component of the security concept. They protect against known and new threats to computers and networks. A firewall offers the highest level of protection if its functions are known, its operation is simple, and it is ideally positioned in the surrounding infrastructure. __OPNsense__ accepts the challenge and meets these criteria in different ways. This book is the ideal companion for understanding, installing and setting up an __OPNsense__ firewall.

Each chapter explains a real-world situation, describes the theoretical fundamentals, and presents a laboratory experiment for better understanding. Finally, it offers a solution using __OPNsense__ methods and knowledge from a technical background.
